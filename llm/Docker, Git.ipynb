    "## What is Docker?\n",
    "DOCKER is computer software used for Virtualization in order to have multiple Operating systems running on the same host. Unlike Hypervisors which are used for creating VM (Virtual machines), virtualization in Docker is performed on system-level in so-called Docker containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the difference in the image below, Docker containers run on top of the host's Operation system. This helps you to improves efficiency and security. Moreover, we can run more containers on the same infrastructure than we can run Virtual machines because containers use fewer resources.\n",

    "Unlike the VMs which can communicate with the hardware of the host (ex: Ethernet adapter to create more virtual adapters) Docker containers run in an isolated environment on top of the host's OS. Even if your host runs Windows OS, you can have Linux images running in containers with the help of Hyper-V, which automatically creates small VM to virtualize the system's base image, in this case, Linux.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's talk about Docker main components in the Docker Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is the client-server type of application which means we have clients who relay to the server. So the Docker daemon called: dockerd is the Docker engine which represents the server. The docker daemon and the clients can be run on the same or remote host, and they communicate through command line client binary, as well as a full RESTful API to interact with the daemon: dockerd.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker images are the \"source code\" for our containers; we use them to build containers. They can have software pre-installed which speeds up deployment. They are portable, and we can use existing images or build our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Registries\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker stores the images we build in registries. There are public and private registries. Docker company has public registry called Docker hub, where you can also store images privately. Docker hub has millions of images, which you can start using now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers are the organizational units of Docker. When we build an image and start running it; we are running in a container. The container analogy is used because of the portability of the software we have running in our container. We can move it, in other words, \"ship\" the software, modify, manage, create or get rid of it, destroy it, just as cargo ships can do with real containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, an image is a template, and a container is a copy of that template. You can have multiple containers (copies) of the same image.\n",

Throughout this tutorial, you'll run docker run multiple times and leaving stray containers will eat up disk space. Hence, as a rule of thumb, I clean up containers once I'm done with them. To do that, you can run the docker rm command. Just copy the container IDs from above and paste them alongside the command.\n",

    "### What is Virtualization?\n",
    "Earlier, the process for deploying a service was slow and painful. First, the developers were writing code; then the operations team would deploy it on bare metal machines, where they had to look out for library versions, patches, and language compilers for the code to work. If there were some bugs or errors, the process would start all over again, the developers would fix it, and then again the operational team was there to deploy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There was an improvement with the creation of Hypervisors. Hypervisors have multiple Virtual machines or VMs on the same host, which may be running or turned off. VMs decreased the waiting time for deploying code and bug fixing in a big manner, but the real game changer was Docker containers.\n",

    "## What is version control\n",
    " \n",
    "### Benefits of version control\n",
    "Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "For almost all software projects, the source code is like the crown jewels - a precious asset whose value must be protected. For most software teams, the source code is a repository of the invaluable knowledge and understanding about the problem domain that the developers have collected and refined through careful effort. Version control protects source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software developers working in teams are continually writing new source code and changing existing source code. The code for a project, app or software component is typically organized in a folder structure or \"file tree\". One developer on the team may be working on a new feature while another developer fixes an unrelated bug by changing code, each developer may make their changes in several parts of the file tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control helps teams solve these kinds of problems, tracking every individual change by each contributor and helping prevent concurrent work from conflicting. Changes made in one part of the software can be incompatible with those made by another developer working at the same time. This problem should be discovered and solved in an orderly manner without blocking the work of the rest of the team. Further, in all software development, any change can introduce new bugs on its own and new software can't be trusted until it's tested. So testing and development proceed together until a new version is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good version control software supports a developer's preferred workflow without imposing one particular way of working. Ideally it also works on any platform, rather than dictate what operating system or tool chain developers must use. Great version control systems facilitate a smooth and continuous flow of changes to the code rather than the frustrating and clumsy mechanism of file locking - giving the green light to one developer at the expense of blocking the progress of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software teams that do not use any form of version control often run into problems like not knowing which changes that have been made are available to users or the creation of incompatible changes between two unrelated pieces of work that must then be painstakingly untangled and reworked. If you're a developer who has never used version control you may have added versions to your files, perhaps with suffixes like \"final\" or \"latest\" and then had to later deal with a new final version. Perhaps you've commented out code blocks because you want to disable certain functionality without deleting the code, fearing that there may be a use for it later. Version control is a way out of these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control software is an essential part of the every-day of the modern software team's professional practices. Individual software developers who are accustomed to working with a capable version control system in their teams typically recognize the incredible value version control also gives them even on small solo projects. Once accustomed to the powerful benefits of version control systems, many developers wouldn't consider working without it even for non-software projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of version control systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing software without using version control is risky, like not having backups. Version control can also enable developers to move faster and it allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility as the team scales to include more developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version Control Systems (VCS) have seen great improvements over the past few decades and some are better than others. VCS are sometimes known as SCM (Source Code Management) tools or RCS (Revision Control System). One of the most popular VCS tools in use today is called Git. Git is a Distributed VCS, a category known as DVCS, more on that later. Like many of the most popular VCS systems available today, Git is free and open source. Regardless of what they are called, or which system is used, the primary benefits you should expect from version control are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A complete long-term change history of every file. This means every change made by many individuals over the years. Changes include the creation and deletion of files as well as edits to their contents. Different VCS tools differ on how well they handle renaming and moving of files. This history should also include the author, date and written notes on the purpose of each change. Having the complete history enables going back to previous versions to help in root cause analysis for bugs and it is crucial when needing to fix problems in older versions of software. If the software is being actively worked on, almost everything can be considered an \"older version\" of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Branching and merging. Having team members work concurrently is a no-brainer, but even individuals working on their own can benefit from the ability to work on independent streams of changes. Creating a \"branch\" in VCS tools keeps multiple streams of work independent from each other while also providing the facility to merge that work back together, enabling developers to verify that the changes on each branch do not conflict. Many software teams adopt a practice of branching for each feature or perhaps branching for each release, or both. There are many different workflows that teams can choose from when they decide how to make use of branching and merging facilities in VCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Traceability. Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking software such as Jira, and being able to annotate each change with a message describing the purpose and intent of the change can help not only with root cause analysis and other forensics. Having the annotated history of the code at your fingertips when you are reading the code, trying to understand what it is doing and why it is so designed can enable developers to make correct and harmonious changes that are in accord with the intended long-term design of the system. This can be especially important for working effectively with legacy code and is crucial in enabling developers to estimate future work with any accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Git\n",
    "### Performance Security Flexibility Version control with Git\n",
    "By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw performance characteristics of Git are very strong when compared to many alternatives. Committing new changes, branching, merging and comparing past versions are all optimized for performance. The algorithms implemented inside Git take advantage of deep knowledge about common attributes of real source code file trees, how they are usually modified over time and what the access patterns are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike some version control software, Git is not fooled by the names of the files when determining what the storage and version history of the file tree should be, instead, Git focuses on the file content itself. After all, source code files are frequently renamed, split, and rearranged. The object format of Git's repository files uses a combination of delta encoding (storing content differences), compression and explicitly stores directory contents and version metadata objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being distributed enables significant performance benefits as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say a developer, Alice, makes changes to source code, adding a feature for the upcoming 2.0 release, then commits those changes with descriptive messages. She then works on a second feature and commits those changes too. Naturally these are stored as separate pieces of work in the version history. Alice then switches to the version 1.3 branch of the same software to fix a bug that affects only that older version. The purpose of this is to enable Alice's team to ship a bug fix release, version 1.3.1, before version 2.0 is ready. Alice can then return to the 2.0 branch to continue working on new features for 2.0 and all of this can occur without any network access and is therefore fast and reliable. She could even do it on an airplane. When she is ready to send all of the individually committed changes to the remote repository, Alice can \"push\" them in one command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security\n",

    "Git has been designed with the integrity of managed source code as a top priority. The content of the files as well as the true relationships between files and directories, versions, tags and commits, all of these objects in the Git repository are secured with a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA1. This protects the code and the change history against both accidental and malicious change and ensures that the history is fully traceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Git, you can be sure you have an authentic content history of your source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other version control systems have no protections against secret alteration at a later date. This can be a serious information security vulnerability for any organization that relies on software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Git's key design objectives is flexibility. Git is flexible in several respects: in support for various kinds of nonlinear development workflows, in its efficiency in both small and large projects and in its compatibility with many existing systems and protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git has been designed to support branching and tagging as first-class citizens (unlike SVN) and operations that affect branches and tags (such as merging or reverting) are also stored as part of the change history. Not all version control systems feature this level of tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version control with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is the best choice for most software teams today. While every team is different and should do their own analysis, here are the main reasons why version control with Git is preferred over alternatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git is good\n",
    "Git has the functionality, performance, security and flexibility that most teams and individual developers need. These attributes of Git are detailed above. In side-by-side comparisons with most other alternatives, many teams find that Git is very favorable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git is a de facto standard\n",
    "Git is the most broadly adopted tool of its kind. This is makes Git attractive for the following reasons. At Atlassian, nearly all of our project source code is managed in Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vast numbers of developers already have Git experience and a significant proportion of college graduates may have experience with only Git. While some organizations may need to climb the learning curve when migrating to Git from another version control system, many of their existing and future developers do not need to be trained on Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the benefits of a large talent pool, the predominance of Git also means that many third party software tools and services are already integrated with Git including IDEs, and our own tools like DVCS desktop client Sourcetree, issue and project tracking software, Jira, and code hosting service, Bitbucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are an inexperienced developer wanting to build up valuable skills in software development tools, when it comes to version control, Git should be on your list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git is a quality open source project\n",
    "Git is a very well supported open source project with over a decade of solid stewardship. The project maintainers have shown balanced judgment and a mature approach to meeting the long term needs of its users with regular releases that improve usability and functionality. The quality of the open source software is easily scrutinized and countless businesses rely heavily on that quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git enjoys great community support and a vast user base. Documentation is excellent and plentiful, including books, tutorials and dedicated web sites. There are also podcasts and video tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being open source lowers the cost for hobbyist developers as they can use Git without paying a fee. For use in open-source projects, Git is undoubtedly the successor to the previous generations of successful open source version control systems, SVN and CVS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Criticism of Git\n",
    "One common criticism of Git is that it can be difficult to learn. Some of the terminology in Git will be novel to newcomers and for users of other systems, the Git terminology may be different, for example, revert in Git has a different meaning than in SVN or CVS. Nevertheless, Git is very capable and provides a lot of power to its users. Learning to use that power can take some time, however once it has been learned, that power can be used by the team to increase their development speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those teams coming from a non-distributed VCS, having a central repository may seem like a good thing that they don't want to lose. However, while Git has been designed as a distributed version control system (DVCS), with Git, you can still have an official, canonical repository where all changes to the software must be stored. With Git, because each developer's repository is complete, their work doesn't need to be constrained by the availability and performance of the \"central\" server. During outages or while offline, developers can still consult the full project history. Because Git is flexible as well as being distributed, you can work the way you are accustomed to but gain the additional benefits of Git, some of which you may not even realise you're missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand what version control is, what Git is and why software teams should use it, read on to discover the benefits Git can provide across the whole organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Git for your organization\n",
    "Git for developers Git for marketing Git for product management Git for designers Git for customer support Git for human resources Git for anyone managing a budget\n",
    "Switching from a centralized version control system to Git changes the way your development team creates software. And, if you’re a company that relies on its software for mission-critical applications, altering your development workflow impacts your entire business.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using feature branches is not only more reliable than directly editing production code, but it also provides organizational benefits. They let you represent development work at the same granularity as the your agile backlog. For example, you might implement a policy where each Jira ticket is addressed in its own feature branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distributed Development\n",
    "In SVN, each developer gets a working copy that points back to a single central repository. Git, however, is a distributed version control system. Instead of a working copy, each developer gets their own local repository, complete with a full history of commits.\n",

With Git, this kind of blocking doesn’t exist. Everybody can continue going about their business in their own local repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, similar to feature branches, distributed development creates a more reliable environment. Even if a developer obliterates their own repository, they can simply clone someone else’s and start anew.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pull Requests\n",
    "Many source code management tools such as Bitbucket enhance core Git functionality with pull requests. A pull request is a way to ask another developer to merge one of your branches into their repository. This not only makes it easier for project leads to keep track of changes, but also lets developers initiate discussions around their work before integrating it with the rest of the codebase."

    "The ultimate result of feature branches, distributed development, pull requests, and a stable community is a faster release cycle.

Marketing can only make one announcement that focuses primarily on the game-changing feature, and the marketing potential of the other two updates is effectively ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shorter development cycle facilitated by Git makes it much easier to divide these into individual releases. This gives marketers more to talk about, more often.

Included below are workflow examples of repositories both created locally and cloned from remote repositories. This guide assumes a basic familiarity with a command-line interface.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Initializing a new Git repo\n",
    "- Cloning an existing Git repo\n",
    "- Committing a modified version of a file to the repo\n",
    "- Configuring a Git repo for remote collaboration\n",
    "- Common Git version control commands\n",

    "\n",
    "A Git repository is a virtual storage of your project. It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Initializing a new repository: git init\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new repo, you'll use the git init command. git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo. Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working directory. This will also create a new master branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Versioning an existing project with a new git repository\n",
    "This example assumes you already have an existing project folder that you would like to create a repo within. You'll first cd to the root project folder and then execute the git init command.\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd /path/to/your/existing/code git init\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointing git init to an existing project directory will execute the same initialization setup as mentioned above, but scoped to that project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    git init \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloning an existing repository: git clone\n",
    "\n",
    "If a project has already been set up in a central repository, the clone command is the most common way for users to obtain a local development clone. Like git init, cloning is generally a one-time operation. Once a developer has obtained a working copy, all version control operations are managed through their local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "    git clone \n",
    "git clone is used to create a copy or clone of remote repositories. You pass git clone a repository URL. Git supports a few different network protocols and corresponding URL formats. In this example, we'll be using the Git SSH protocol. Git SSH URLs follow a template of: \n",
    "\n",
    "git@HOSTNAME:USERNAME/REPONAME.git\n",
    "\n",
    "An example Git SSH URL would be: \n",

    "\n",
    "- HOSTNAME: bitbucket.org\n",
    "- USERNAME: rhyolight\n",
    "- REPONAME: javascript-data-store\n",
    "\n",
    "When executed, the latest version of the remote repo files on the master branch will be pulled down and added to a new folder. The new folder will be named after the REPONAME in this case javascript-data-store. The folder will contain the full history of the remote repository and a newly created master branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saving changes to the repository: git add and git commit\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a repository cloned or initialized, you can commit file version changes to it. The following example assumes you have set up a project at /path/to/project. The steps being taken in this example are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change directories to /path/to/project\n",
    "- Create a new file CommitTest.txt with contents ~\"test content for git tutorial\"~\n",
    "- git add CommitTest.txt to the repository staging area\n",
    "- Create a new commit with a message describing what work was done in the commit\n",

    "    \n",
    "## Repo-to-repo collaboration: git push\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to understand that Git’s idea of a “working copy” is very different from the working copy you get by checking out source code from an SVN repository. Unlike SVN, Git makes no distinction between the working copies and the central repository—they're all full-fledged Git repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes collaborating with Git fundamentally different than with SVN. Whereas SVN depends on the relationship between the central repository and the working copy, Git’s collaboration model is based on repository-to-repository interaction. Instead of checking a working copy into SVN’s central repository, you push or pull commits from one repository to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there’s nothing stopping you from giving certain Git repos special meaning. For example, by simply designating one Git repo as the “central” repository, it’s possible to replicate a centralized workflow using Git. This is accomplished through conventions rather than being hardwired into the VCS itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bare vs. cloned repositories\n",
    "If you used git clone in the previous \"Initializing a new Repository\" section to set up your local repository, your repository is already configured for remote collaboration. git clone will automatically configure your repo with a remote pointed to the Git URL you cloned it from. This means that once you make changes to a file and commit them, you can git push those changes to the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you used git init to make a fresh repo, you'll have no remote repo to push changes to. A common pattern when initializing a new repo is to go to a hosted Git service like Bitbucket and create a repo there. The service will provide a Git URL that you can then add to your local Git repository and git push to the hosted repo. Once you have created a remote repo with your service of choice you will need to update your local repo with a mapping. We discuss this process in the Configuration & Set Up guide below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to host your own remote repo, you'll need to set up a \"Bare Repository.\" Both git init and git clone accept a --bare argument. The most common use case for bare repo is to create a remote central Git repository\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration & set up: git config\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a remote repo setup, you will need to add a remote repo url to your local git config, and set an upstream branch for your local branches. The git remote command offers such utility.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "    git remote add\n",
    "    \n",
    "This command will map remote repository at  to a ref in your local repo under . Once you have mapped the remote repo you can push local branches to it.\n",

    "\n",
    "This command will push the local repo branch under  to the remote repo at .\n",
    "\n",
    "For more in-depth look at git remote, see the Git remote page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to configuring a remote repo URL, you may also need to set global Git configuration options such as username, or email. The git config command lets you configure your Git installation (or an individual repository) from the command line. This command can define everything from user info, to preferences, to the behavior of a repository. Several common configuration options are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git stores configuration options in three separate files, which lets you scope options to individual repositories (local), user (Global), or the entire system (system):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local: /.git/config – Repository-specific settings.\n",
    "- Global: /.gitconfig – User-specific settings. This is where options set with the --global flag are stored.\n",

    "When working in Git, or other version control systems, the concept of \"saving\" is a more nuanced process than saving in a word processor or other traditional file editing applications. The traditional software expression of \"saving\" is synonymous with the Git term \"committing\". A commit is the Git equivalent of a \"save\". Traditional saving should be thought of as a file system operation that is used to overwrite an existing file or write a new file. Alternatively, Git committing is an operation that acts upon a collection of files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving changes in Git vs SVN is also a different process. SVN Commits or 'check-ins' are operations that make a remote push to a centralized server. This means an SVN commit needs Internet access in order to fully 'save' project changes. Git commits can be captured and built up locally, then pushed to a remote server as needed using the git push -u origin master command. The difference between the two methods is a fundamental difference between architecture designs. Git is a distributed application model whereas SVN is a centralized model. Distributed applications are generally more robust as they do not have a single point of failure like a centralized server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands: git add, git status, and git commit are all used in combination to save a snapshot of a Git project's current state.\n",

The stash operates on the working directory, the first of the three trees and has extensive usage options. To learn more visit the git stash page.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Git repository can be configured to ignore specific files or directories. This will prevent Git from saving changes to any ignored content. Git has multiple methods of configuration that manage the ignore list. Git ignore configure is discussed in further detail on the git ignore page.\n",

    "\n",
    "The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conjunction with these commands, you'll also need git status to view the state of the working directory and the staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "The git add and git commit commands compose the fundamental Git workflow. These are the two commands that every Git user needs to understand, regardless of their team’s collaboration model. They are the means to record versions of a project into the repository’s history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing a project revolves around the basic edit/stage/commit pattern. First, you edit your files in the working directory. When you’re ready to save a copy of the current state of the project, you stage changes with git add. After you’re happy with the staged snapshot, you commit it to the project history with git commit. The git reset command is used to undo a commit or staged snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to git add and git commit, a third command git push is essential for a complete collaborative Git workflow. git push is utilized to send the committed changes to remote repositories for collaboration. This enables other team members to access a set of saved changes."

This is different from Git's distributed collaboration model, which gives every developer their own copy of the repository, complete with its own local history and branch structure. Users typically need to share a series of commits rather than a single changeset. Instead of committing a changeset from a working copy to the central repository, Git lets you share entire branches between repositories.\n",

    "This document is an in-depth review of the git branch command and a discussion of the overall Git branching model. Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems. Branching in other VCS's can be an expensive operation in both time and disk space. In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before merging it into the main branch.\n",

    "\n",
    "The implementation behind Git branches is much more lightweight than other version control system models. Instead of copying files from directory to directory, Git stores a branch as a reference to a commit. In this sense, a branch represents the tip of a series of commits—it's not a container for commits. The history for a branch is extrapolated through the commit relationships.\n",

    "\n",
    "A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn’t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.\n",
