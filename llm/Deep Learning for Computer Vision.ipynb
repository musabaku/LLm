A first convolution layer will learn small local patterns such as edges, a second convolution layer will learn larger patterns made of the features of the first layers, and so on.

    "### The max-pooling operation\n",

    "the feature map is 26 × 26, but the max-pooling operation halves it to 13 × 13.\n",

    "\n",
    "Max pooling consists of extracting windows from the input feature maps and outputting\n",
    "the max value of each channel. It’s conceptually similar to convolution, except\n",
    "that instead of transforming local patches via a learned linear transformation (the convolution\n",

    "What’s wrong with this setup? Two things:\n",
    "- It isn’t conducive to learning a spatial hierarchy of features. The 3 × 3 windows in the third layer will only contain information coming from 7 × 7 windows in the initial input. The high-level patterns learned by the convnet will still be very small with regard to the initial input, which may not be enough to learn to classify digits (try recognizing a digit by only looking at it through windows that are 7 × 7 pixels!). We need the features from the last convolution layer to contain information about the totality of the input.\n",
    "- The final feature map has 22 × 22 × 64 = 30,976 total coefficients per sample. This is huge. If you were to flatten it to stick a Dense layer of size 512 on top, that layer would have 15.8 million parameters. This is far too large for such a small model and would result in intense overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the reason to use downsampling is to reduce the number of feature-map\n",

    "Note that max pooling isn’t the only way you can achieve such downsampling. As\n",
    "you already know, you can also use strides in the prior convolution layer. And you can use average pooling instead of max pooling, where each local input patch is transformed\n",
    "by taking the average value of each channel over the patch, rather than the\n",
    "max. But max pooling tends to work better than these alternative solutions. In a nutshell,\n",
    "the reason is that features tend to encode the spatial presence of some pattern\n",
    "or concept over the different tiles of the feature map (hence, the term feature map),\n",
    "and it’s more informative to look at the maximal presence of different features than at\n",
    "their average presence. So the most reasonable subsampling strategy is to first produce\n",
    "dense maps of features (via unstrided convolutions) and then look at the maximal\n",

    "\n",
    "## Training a convnet from scratch on a small dataset\n",
    "Having to train an image-classification model using very little data is a common situation,\n",
    "which you’ll likely encounter in practice if you ever do computer vision in a\n",
    "professional context. A “few” samples can mean anywhere from a few hundred to a\n",
    "few tens of thousands of images. As a practical example, we’ll focus on classifying\n",
    "images as dogs or cats, in a dataset containing 4,000 pictures of cats and dogs (2,000\n",
    "cats, 2,000 dogs). We’ll use 2,000 pictures for training—1,000 for validation, and\n",
    "1,000 for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ll review one basic strategy to tackle this problem: training a new\n",
    "model from scratch using what little data you have. You’ll start by naively training a\n",
    "small convnet on the 2,000 training samples, without any regularization, to set a baseline\n",
    "for what can be achieved. This will get you to a classification accuracy of 71%. At\n",
    "that point, the main issue will be overfitting. Then we’ll introduce data augmentation, a\n",
    "powerful technique for mitigating overfitting in computer vision. By using data augmentation,\n",
    "you’ll improve the network to reach an accuracy of 82%.\n",
    "In the next section, we’ll review two more essential techniques for applying deep\n",
    "learning to small datasets: feature extraction with a pretrained network (which will get you\n",
    "to an accuracy of 90% to 96%) and fine-tuning a pretrained network (this will get you to a\n",
    "final accuracy of 97%). Together, these three strategies—training a small model from\n",
    "scratch, doing feature extraction using a pretrained model, and fine-tuning a pretrained\n",
    "model—will constitute your future toolbox for tackling the problem of performing\n",
    "image classification with small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The relevance of deep learning for small-data problems\n",
    "You’ll sometimes hear that deep learning only works when lots of data is available.\n",
    "This is valid in part: one fundamental characteristic of deep learning is that it can find\n",
    "interesting features in the training data on its own, without any need for manual feature\n",
    "engineering, and this can only be achieved when lots of training examples are\n",
    "available. This is especially true for problems where the input samples are very highdimensional,\n",
    "like images.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what constitutes lots of samples is relative—relative to the size and depth of the\n",
    "network you’re trying to train, for starters. It isn’t possible to train a convnet to solve a\n",
    "complex problem with just a few tens of samples, but a few hundred can potentially\n",
    "suffice if the model is small and well regularized and the task is simple. Because convnets\n",
    "learn local, translation-invariant features, they’re highly data efficient on perceptual\n",
    "problems. Training a convnet from scratch on a very small image dataset will still\n",
    "yield reasonable results despite a relative lack of data, without the need for any custom\n",
    "feature engineering. You’ll see this in action in this section.\n",
    "What’s more, deep-learning models are by nature highly repurposable: you can\n",
    "take, say, an image-classification or speech-to-text model trained on a large-scale dataset\n",
    "and reuse it on a significantly different problem with only minor changes. Specifically, in the case of computer vision, many pretrained models (usually trained on the Image-\n",
    "Net dataset) are now publicly available for download and can be used to bootstrap powerful\n",
    "vision models out of very little data. That’s what you’ll do in the next section. Let’s\n",
    "start by getting your hands on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading the data\n",

    "trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image-classification task. If this\n",
    "original dataset is large enough and general enough, then the spatial hierarchy of features\n",
    "learned by the pretrained network can effectively act as a generic model of the\n",
    "visual world, and hence its features can prove useful for many different computer vision\n",
    "problems, even though these new problems may involve completely different\n",
    "classes than those of the original task. For instance, you might train a network on\n",
    "ImageNet (where classes are mostly animals and everyday objects) and then repurpose\n",
    "this trained network for something as remote as identifying furniture items in\n",
    "images. Such portability of learned features across different problems is a key advantage\n",
    "of deep learning compared to many older, shallow-learning approaches, and it\n",
    "makes deep learning very effective for small-data problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, let’s consider a large convnet trained on the ImageNet dataset\n",
    "(1.4 million labeled images and 1,000 different classes). ImageNet contains many animal\n",
    "classes, including different species of cats and dogs, and you can thus expect to\n",

    "Although it’s an older model, far from the current state of the art and somewhat\n",

    "- On a small dataset, overfitting will be the main issue. Data augmentation is a powerful way to fight overfitting when you’re working with image data.\n",
    "- It’s easy to reuse an existing convnet on a new dataset via feature extraction. This is a valuable technique for working with small image datasets.\n",

    "that are difficult to extract and present in a human-readable form. Although this is\n",
    "partially true for certain types of deep-learning models, it’s definitely not true for\n",
    "convnets. The representations learned by convnets are highly amenable to visualization,\n",
    "in large part because they’re representations of visual concepts. Since 2013, a wide\n",
    "array of techniques have been developed for visualizing and interpreting these representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won’t survey all of them, but we’ll cover three of the most accessible\n",
    "and useful ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualizing intermediate convnet outputs (intermediate activations)—Useful for understanding how successive convnet layers transform their input, and for getting a first idea of the meaning of individual convnet filters.\n",
    "- Visualizing convnets filters—Useful for understanding precisely what visual pattern or concept each filter in a convnet is receptive to.\n",
    "- Visualizing heatmaps of class activation in an image—Useful for understanding which parts of an image were identified as belonging to a given class, thus allowing you to localize objects in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first method—activation visualization—you’ll use the small convnet that you\n",
    "trained from scratch on the dogs-versus-cats classification problem in section 5.2. For\n",
    "the next two methods, you’ll use the VGG16 model introduced in section 5.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizing intermediate activations\n",
    "Visualizing intermediate activations consists of displaying the feature maps that are\n",
    "output by various convolution and pooling layers in a network, given a certain input\n",
    "(the output of a layer is often called its activation, the output of the activation function).\n",
